### Backend-Focused Software Engineer · System Design Ownership · Practicing Engineer Who Teaches

Hi 👋 I’m **Avishek Devnath**, a **backend-focused Software Engineer** with hands-on experience designing and owning systems under **real operational constraints**. Alongside engineering work, I serve as a **Senior CS Instructor at Phitron**, which reinforces my fundamentals and communication — but my primary identity is as a **system-building engineer**, not an educator.

I specialize in taking systems from **unclear requirements to production-ready architectures**, making and owning design decisions around **data flow, authorization, scalability, and long-term maintainability**, and living with those decisions as systems evolve.

---

## 🧭 Engineering Philosophy

I approach software engineering from a **systems-first perspective**.

Rather than optimizing for frameworks or novelty, I focus on:
- defining **clear system boundaries**
- designing **data models that reflect access patterns**
- making **explicit trade-offs** under constraints
- building systems that remain understandable **after months of change**

I care deeply about how systems behave **after launch** — under load, during failures, and as requirements shift.

## 🏗️ System Design & Ownership

I have designed and built **internal and public-facing platforms used by hundreds of active users**, where I owned decisions across the full lifecycle:

- architecture and service boundaries  
- backend APIs and data modeling  
- authentication and RBAC-heavy authorization flows  
- background processing and long-running tasks  
- iteration, maintenance, and refactoring in active use  

These systems were **deployed, evolved, and maintained over time**, shaped by real user behavior and increasing complexity rather than static specifications. I have worked through the consequences of early design choices and adjusted architectures as systems matured.

## 🔐 Biometrics & Privacy-Driven Systems

One representative example of my system-level work is an **offline, consent-based biometric face recognition system**.

Key design decisions included:
- **Offline inference** to eliminate data exfiltration risk and simplify trust boundaries  
- **Template-based matching** instead of raw image storage  
- Explicit trade-offs between **privacy guarantees, latency, accuracy, and storage**  
- Avoiding cloud-dependent or always-online defaults where they introduced unnecessary risk  

This system was designed with **security, ethics, and operational clarity** as first-class concerns, rather than treating them as add-ons.

## 🤖 Backend Systems with ML Components

I have designed **backend platforms that integrate ML components as part of larger systems**, including:
- an **end-to-end customer churn prediction pipeline**
- an **enterprise-style RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) knowledge platform**

In these systems, my focus was not on model novelty, but on:
- **data flow design** from ingestion to output  
- **retrieval accuracy vs. latency trade-offs**  
- **cost control and predictability**  
- **traceability and explainability of outputs**  

ML components were treated as **subsystems within production architectures**, designed to behave reliably alongside traditional backend services.

---

## 🌐 Full-Stack Systems (Backend-Led)

I have also built **SaaS-style full-stack systems** where backend correctness and clarity were more important than surface-level features.

These platforms involved:
- authentication and authorization as core system concerns  
- role-based access control  
- real-world workflows rather than demo flows  
- backend-driven contracts between services and UI  

Frontend work supported system goals, but architectural decisions remained backend-led.

---

## ⚙️ Technology Choices & Trade-Offs

I choose tools based on **engineering trade-offs**, not preference:

- **Go** — backend services where performance, concurrency, and operational simplicity matter  
- **Python** — data-heavy workflows and ML pipelines  
- **TypeScript (Node.js, Next.js)** — user-facing systems requiring rapid iteration with strong type safety  
- **Databases** — PostgreSQL and MongoDB, selected based on access patterns and consistency needs  

Across systems, I design explicitly for:
- failure modes  
- background processing and retries  
- data consistency under concurrency  
- scalability limits and operational clarity  

---

## 🧩 Problem Solving & Fundamentals

I have solved **500+ data structures and algorithms problems**, which directly informs how I reason about backend systems.

This background helps me:
- analyze performance bottlenecks  
- reason about time–space trade-offs  
- anticipate scaling behavior  
- avoid accidental complexity in system design  

Problem solving serves **engineering judgment**, not competitive programming.

---

## 🧑‍🏫 Teaching & Mentorship (Supporting Strength)

Alongside engineering, I work as a **Senior CS Instructor at Phitron**, where I have mentored **1,000+ students** in core computer science and software engineering.

Teaching has strengthened my ability to:
- design systems that are easy to reason about  
- write maintainable, readable code  
- communicate technical trade-offs clearly within teams  

This role supports my engineering effectiveness rather than defining my professional identity.
