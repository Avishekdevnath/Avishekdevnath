### Backend-Focused Software Engineer · System Design Ownership

Hi 👋 I’m **Avishek Devnath**, a **backend-focused Software Engineer** with hands-on experience designing and owning systems under **real operational constraints**. I currently work as a **Senior CS Instructor at Phitron**, but my primary identity is as a **system-building engineer**, not an educator.

I specialize in taking systems from **unclear requirements to production architectures**, owning design decisions around **data flow, authorization, scalability, and long-term maintainability**, and living with those decisions as systems evolve.

---

## 🏗️ System Design & Ownership

I’ve designed and built **internal and public-facing platforms used in active environments**, owning systems across their full lifecycle:

- architecture and service boundaries  
- backend APIs and data modeling  
- authentication and RBAC-heavy authorization flows  
- background processing and long-running tasks  
- iteration, maintenance, and refactoring after launch  

These systems were **deployed, evolved, and maintained over time**, shaped by real user behavior and increasing complexity rather than static specifications.

## 🔐 Representative Systems

### 🏫 Product Systems (Core Work)

**SMS-Web — Role-Based Student Management Platform**  
Designed and built a **backend-led, RBAC-heavy system** for managing students, invitations, and administrative workflows. Owned **data modeling, authentication, authorization logic, and API design**, with a focus on correctness, access control, and long-term maintainability as requirements evolved.

**BrainScale CRM — Internal CRM & Workflow Platform**  
Designed backend systems for an **internal CRM platform** supporting structured workflows, user roles, and operational data tracking. Focused on **service boundaries, permission models, and evolving data schemas**, ensuring the system remained adaptable as business needs changed.

These platforms represent **core product work** where reliability, permissions, and data integrity mattered more than novelty.

---

### 🔐 Biometrics & Privacy-Driven Systems
Designed an **offline, consent-based biometric face recognition system**, where **offline inference** was deliberately chosen to eliminate data exfiltration risk and simplify trust boundaries. The system uses **template-based matching** and balances **privacy, latency, accuracy, and storage** through explicit architectural trade-offs rather than cloud-first defaults.

---

### 🤖 Backend Systems with ML Components
Designed backend platforms that integrate ML as part of larger systems, including an **end-to-end customer churn prediction pipeline** and an **enterprise-style RAG knowledge platform**. The focus was on **data flow design, retrieval accuracy vs. latency trade-offs, cost control, and traceability**, treating ML as a **subsystem within production architectures**, not as isolated experiments.

---

### 📦 Developer Tooling (Python & NPM Packages)
Built and maintained **Python and NPM packages** used as developer tools, focusing on:
- clear APIs and documentation  
- safe defaults and usability  
- packaging, versioning, and distribution  

These projects demonstrate attention to **developer experience**, backward compatibility, and maintaining software consumed by others rather than only internal code.

## ⚙️ Technology & Engineering Trade-Offs

I choose tools based on **engineering trade-offs**, not preference, with a primary focus on **Node.js-based backend systems**:

- **Node.js (NestJS)** — primary backend stack for building structured, maintainable services with clear module boundaries, dependency injection, and RBAC-heavy authorization logic  
- **TypeScript (Next.js)** — user-facing systems requiring rapid iteration, strong typing, and clear contracts with backend services  
- **Go** — backend services where performance, concurrency, and operational simplicity are critical  
- **Python** — data-heavy workflows, ML pipelines, and backend tooling  

- **Databases** — PostgreSQL and MongoDB, selected based on access patterns, consistency requirements, and schema evolution needs

Systems are designed with **failure modes, background processing, retries, and scalability limits** in mind.

---

## 🧩 Fundamentals & Mentorship

I’ve solved **500+ data structures and algorithms problems**, which informs how I reason about performance, scalability, and backend design trade-offs.

Alongside engineering, I mentor as a **Senior CS Instructor at Phitron**, where I’ve guided **1,000+ students** in core computer science and software engineering. Teaching strengthens my ability to design clear systems and communicate technical trade-offs without defining my professional identity.
