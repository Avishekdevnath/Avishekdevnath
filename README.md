### Backend-Focused Software Engineer · System Design Ownership

Hi 👋 I’m **Avishek Devnath**, a **backend-focused Software Engineer** with hands-on experience designing and owning systems under **real operational constraints**. I currently work as a **Senior CS Instructor at Phitron**, but my primary identity is as a **system-building engineer**, not an educator.

I specialize in taking systems from **unclear requirements to production architectures**, owning design decisions around **data flow, authorization, scalability, and long-term maintainability**, and living with those decisions as systems evolve.

## 🏗️ System Design & Ownership

I’ve designed and built **internal and public-facing platforms used by hundreds of active users**, owning systems across their full lifecycle:

- architecture and service boundaries  
- backend APIs and data modeling  
- authentication and RBAC-heavy authorization  
- background processing and long-running tasks  
- iteration, maintenance, and refactoring in active use  

These systems were **deployed, evolved, and maintained over time**, shaped by real user behavior and increasing complexity rather than static specifications.

## 🔐 Representative Systems

### Biometrics & Privacy-Driven Design
Designed an **offline, consent-based biometric face recognition system**, where **offline inference** was chosen to eliminate data exfiltration risk and simplify trust boundaries. The system uses **template-based matching** and balances **privacy, latency, accuracy, and storage** through explicit architectural trade-offs instead of cloud-first defaults.

### Backend Systems with ML Components
Designed backend platforms that integrate ML as part of larger systems, including an **end-to-end customer churn prediction pipeline** and an **enterprise-style RAG knowledge platform**. The focus was on **data flow design, retrieval accuracy vs. latency trade-offs, cost control, and traceability**, treating ML as a subsystem within production architectures.

## ⚙️ Technology & Engineering Trade-Offs

I choose tools based on **engineering trade-offs**, not preference:

- **Go** — backend services where performance, concurrency, and operational simplicity matter  
- **Python** — data-heavy workflows and ML pipelines  
- **TypeScript (Node.js, Next.js)** — user-facing systems requiring rapid iteration with strong type safety  
- **Databases** — PostgreSQL and MongoDB, selected based on access patterns and consistency needs  

Systems are designed with **failure modes, background processing, retries, and scalability limits** in mind.

## 🧩 Fundamentals & Mentorship

I’ve solved **500+ data structures and algorithms problems**, which informs how I reason about performance, scalability, and backend design trade-offs.

Alongside engineering, I mentor as a **Senior CS Instructor at Phitron**, where I’ve guided **1,000+ students** in core computer science and software engineering. Teaching strengthens my ability to design clear systems and communicate technical trade-offs without defining my professional identity.
